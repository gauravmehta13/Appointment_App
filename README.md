> Our idea is to create mainly an appointment application for patients who can easily get an appointment to nearby hospital or doctor.
> Not only this we will provide a mini assistant like a doctor suppose a person is suffering from some kind of illness and he/she don't know about the drug or salt to take so > our app will provide the particular salt or medicine to take. 
> What we more thought about this app that it will keep the track of history of appointments and payments etc...
> For knowledge perspective the users of our app we will be notifying the person with health related tips, life saving techniques, first aid etc ....

<h2>Features</h2>
 
* **Doctor profiles** — Patients should be able to browse doctor profiles to choose the doctor they like. Profiles should contain information on certifications, experience, competencies, and languages spoken. It will be useful if you include ratings and feedback from previous and current patients so users can know whether a doctor met the expectations of past patients in terms of communication, treatment, competence, etc. <br />
* **Search for a doctor** — Let patients search for healthcare providers by specialty, ratings, experience, and location.<br />
* **Book and manage appointments** — Patients should be able to schedule an appointment with a doctor using a calendar. Also, make sure users can cancel and reschedule appointments.<br />
* **Reminders** — Push notifications work well for automating regular interactions between patients and clinics, such as reminding patients about appointments. You may consider notifying patients a few times so they don’t forget about an upcoming appointment, but be careful not to overdo it.<br />
